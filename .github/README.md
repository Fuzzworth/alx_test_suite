# 0x16 ALX SIMPLE SHELL TEST SUITE
## DESCRIPTION

- This is a set of testing scripts for all simple shell tasks except betty and memory checks with valgrind.
- This suite is tested on Ubuntu 20.04 WSL.

## FEATURES

- Runs a checker on your compiled code and displays `OK` if you have the expected output.
- Displays command to be executed before it starts.
- Displays number of `OK` outputs at the end and total number of commands run.
- Check only specific tasks instead of whole suite at once.

*DISCLAIMER: Currently cannot check for valgrind errors so you must do that manually. If you get OK and also no memory leaks then expect GREEN on the Intranet. If you get OK and you have memory errors you will get RED in the intranet.*

## HOW TO USE

#### copy & paste each highlighted command to your terminal and press `enter â†²` one after the other.

1. `git clone` clone this repo into your simple_shell directory
2. `cd TEST_SUITE` - Navigate to TEST_SUITE
3. `chmod +x checker.bash runchecker.bash` - make them executable
4. `mv runchecker.bash ../runchecker.bash` - move runchecker.bash to your simple_shell directory.
5. `cd ..` - Navigate back to simple_shell
6. Create a `.gitignore` file in your repo if you don't already have one and add these lines inside it
```gitignore
TEST_SUITE
allowed_functions
```

7. `./runchecker.bash` - to run the whole suite from task 1 - 16 at once.

--- OPTIONS ---
- `./runchecker.bash #` - replace # with a number from 1- 16 to only run checks from a specific task e.g. to check task 3 only, do `./runchecker.bash 3`
